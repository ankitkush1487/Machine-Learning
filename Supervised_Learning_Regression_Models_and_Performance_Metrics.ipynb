        "\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method that models the relationship between one independent (predictor) variable and one dependent (outcome) variable by fitting a straight line to the data. Its purpose is to quantify the relationship between the two variables, predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable, and understand how changes in the independent variable affect the outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of Simple Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "**Understanding the relationship:** SLR helps determine if a relationship exists between the two variables and how strong it is. For example, a researcher can see how closely test scores are related to hours spent studying.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prediction:** Once the relationship is modeled, it can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable for a new value of the independent variable. For instance, if the model shows that for every additional hour a student studies, their test score increases by 4 points, you can predict their score based on the hours they study.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Quantifying the relationship:** The model provides a line with a slope and an intercept. The slope quantifies how much the dependent variable is expected to change for a one-unit increase in the independent variable. The intercept is the predicted value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.\n",
        "Foundation for more advanced models: Although simple, SLR is a fundamental concept that serves as a building block for more complex regression techniques like multiple linear regression, which uses two or more independent variables"

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors (the absolute difference between the predicted and actual values). Description: It is the average of the absolute differences between the actual observed values and the values predicted by the model.Interpretation: The result is in the same unit as the original target variable, which makes it easy to interpret (e.g., an MAE of 5 in a house price prediction model means the predictions are, on average, off by $5,000).Key Trait: MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE because it does not square the errors, giving all errors equal weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Mean Squared Error (MSE) MSE measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. Description: It is calculated by taking the average of the squared residuals (differences between actual and predicted values).Interpretation: A lower MSE value indicates a better fit. Because the errors are squared, the resulting unit is the square of the original unit, which can be less intuitive to interpret.Key Trait: MSE penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones, making it sensitive to outliers. This makes it a good metric to use when large errors are particularly undesirable.\n",

A higher value generally indicates a better model fit.Key Trait: It is a relative metric that allows for comparing models trained on the same dataset. However, adding more independent variables can sometimes increase \\(R^{2}\\) even if the new features are irrelevant, which led to the development of the adjusted \\(R^{2}\\) metric\n"
